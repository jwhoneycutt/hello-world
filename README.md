# hello-world
starting out w/ github

I have created a readme-edit branch

and am editing it with text

I'm not sure if I have to use any particular syntax

Well, I have learned to add a blank line in lieu of a carriage return!

This is after 2 blank lines
- and this is after no blank lines

Now I can enter the editor and make additions

Pay attention to the colored things on the page, click filename, pencil to edit, commit at bottom
